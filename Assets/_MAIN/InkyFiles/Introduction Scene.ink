//Introduction
- New Orleans hasnâ€™t been this silent in a while. 

- That is when you know your dear friend Cassian has not only given you the invite to his party, but he has given the entire city permission to enter their home. 

 - In other words, the town is going to party so fucking hard tonight, as per usual.
    * Go to Cassian's party.
